## To check

---
Each of the artefacts declared in a `Component Descriptor` has an `identity`, an `access`
description and a `type`. `Artefact identities` can be used to reference an artefact in
the context of the declaring component descriptor. The `Artefact type` defines how the
artefact is to be interpreted. The `access Description` defines from where the artefact
can be retrieved.

When replicating component descriptors and their artefacts, the artefacts' `access` descriptions
may be changed. However, `artefact types` and `artefact identities` always remain unchanged.

## Probably not needed

---
The CNUDIE Component Model can roughly be compared to a filesystem "living" in an arbitrary
storage (e.g. a blobstore, oci-registry, archive, ..).

Starting from an arbitrary component repository used as root repository it is
possible to access any artefact described by the component model as long as the
dedicated component version has been imported into this repository. The
dedicated component repository together with the component version identity
allows to access the component descriptor which then is used to determine the
access for dedicated artefacts given by their local identity. This way the
component respository acts as composed filesystem with fixed top level folders,
the components and their versions, followed by the artefact level, which then
may point into any another (kind of) repository. Sub folders can be described
by component version references described by component descriptors, which again
feature a local identity in the describing component descriptor.
---
The CNUDIE Component model intends to solve the problem of addressing,
identifying, and accessing artefacts for software components, relative to an
arbitrary component repository. By that, it also enables the transport of
software components between component repositories.
